I am a first-year PhD student (MD-PhD program) at the School of Informatics, Xiamen University, advised by Prof. Zhang Zhihong. In 2023, I received a B.Mgt. from South-Central Minzu University. In 2024, I founded the **GenIRAG Team** and have close collaboration with Chentao Zhang (张辰涛), Chenfeng Zheng (郑晨枫), and Yuxuan Hu (胡雨璇).

My research interests focus on Information Retrieval (IR), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graph (KG), and their applications in Power Systems.

My current research topics:

+ **Topic 1**: Trustworthy & Interpretable Information Retrieval;
+ **Topic 2**: AI Applications in Knowledge-Intensive Power Business.
